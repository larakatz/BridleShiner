# Bridle Shiner eDNA Occupancy Models

These models are described in Katz et al. 2024 (in review). Model 1 and Model 2 (./MethodComparison/DetCompare.Rmd) predict  waterbody occupancy (ψ), site availability probability (θ), and sample detection probability (*p*) of Bridle Shiner (*Notropis bifrenatus*) for both seine netting and eDNA at 29 historic waterbodies. Model 3 (./All_eDNA/2_bds_occupancy.Rmd) predicts site occupancy (ψ), eDNA sample availability probability (θ), and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) replicate detection probability (*p*) of Bridle Shiner DNA within 93 historic and novel survey sites. Input data for this model can be prepared using ./All_eDNA/1_Output_prep.Rmd.
